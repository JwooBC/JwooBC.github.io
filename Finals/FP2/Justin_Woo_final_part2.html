    <ul>
      <li><strong>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</strong><br>
      I have had no previous knowledge regarding HTML, CSS, or Javascript.</li>
      
      
      <li><strong>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</strong><br>
      I did use a template, but all the internal content was created and formatted by me.</li>
      
      <li><strong>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio? (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</strong><br>
      The most challenging part of my portfolio in my opinion was formatting everything to look nice.
      If you don't keep track of what you are making, everything can get jumbled up, which makes it really hard to format.</li>
      
      <li><strong>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</strong><br>
      Before taking this class, I thought HTML was very complex and I didn't understand how everything worked. 
      Now I understand there are multiple parts to web development, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</li>
      
      <li><strong>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</strong><br>
      I would recommend future students to manage their time and don't wait to the last minute.
      Assignments can take longer than you expect and it is always important to have enough time to finish the work. 
      <em>Don't procrastinate!</em></li>
